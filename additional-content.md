# üéØ Exam Strategy & Tips

## üìö **Study Approach**

1. **Hands-on Practice**: Create AWS Free Tier account and practice with real services
2. **Architecture Focus**: Understand how services work together, not just individual features
3. **Cost Optimization**: Always consider cost-effective solutions and right-sizing
4. **Security First**: Security and compliance are embedded in every question
5. **Well-Architected Principles**: Frame answers using the 5 pillars

## üß† **Question Analysis Techniques**

1. **Identify Keywords**: Look for requirements like "cost-effective", "highly available", "scalable", "secure"
2. **Eliminate Obviously Wrong**: Rule out services that don't fit the use case
3. **Consider Constraints**: Budget, timeline, compliance, performance requirements
4. **Think Long-term**: Consider operational overhead, maintenance, and growth

## ‚ö° **Common Exam Scenarios**

### High Availability Patterns
- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: RDS Multi-AZ, ELB across multiple AZs
- **Auto Scaling**: Handle varying traffic loads automatically
- **Route 53 Health Checks**: Automated DNS failover

### Cost Optimization Scenarios
- **Reserved Instances**: Predictable workloads, 1-3 year commitments
- **Spot Instances**: Fault-tolerant workloads, batch processing
- **S3 Storage Classes**: Match access patterns to storage costs
- **Right-sizing**: Regular review and adjustment of resource sizes

### Security Implementation
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions only
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit protection
- **Network Isolation**: VPCs, security groups, NACLs

### Disaster Recovery Strategies
- **Backup and Restore**: Lowest cost, longer RTO/RPO
- **Pilot Light**: Core components always running in DR region
- **Warm Standby**: Scaled-down version running in DR region
- **Multi-Site**: Active-active deployment across regions
