**Application Load Balancer (ALB) Listener Rules**

    💡 ALB can redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS at the listener level.

    ➡️ Enforce secure connections by configuring redirect actions.

**HTTPS / SSL Termination**

    💡 SSL/TLS termination happens at the ALB using certificates.

    ➡️ Simplifies encryption management, offloading from EC2 instances.

### 🔐 **Q61 — Database Credentials Rotation**

**AWS Secrets Manager**

    💡 Managed service for storing and automatically rotating secrets.

    ➡️ Secure database credentials without hardcoding; integrates with RDS.

**EC2 IAM Role Access**

    💡 Grants temporary permissions to retrieve secrets securely.

    ➡️ Prevents embedding sensitive data inside application code.

---

### 🧾 **Q62 — SSL/TLS Certificate Rotation**

**AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**

    💡 Manages SSL/TLS certificates for AWS services like ALB.

    ➡️ Supports import of external certificates and automated renewal alerts.

**External CA Integration**

    💡 Import third-party certificates into ACM for managed deployment.

    ➡️ Use EventBridge notifications to track expiration and manual rotation.

### 🖼️ **Q63 — Serverless File Conversion**

**Amazon S3 + Lambda Event Trigger**

    💡 S3 triggers Lambda when files are uploaded.

    ➡️ Enables automatic file transformation (PDF → JPG) at scale.

**Serverless Scalability**

    💡 Lambda auto-scales with demand and has no server management.

    ➡️ Cost-effective for variable workloads with unpredictable traffic.

### 📁 **Q64 — Hybrid Windows File Storage**

**Amazon FSx for Windows File Server**

    💡 Fully managed Windows file system with SMB protocol.

    ➡️ Provides seamless access for on-prem and cloud workloads.

**FSx File Gateway**

    💡 Extends FSx storage to on-prem environments with low latency.

    ➡️ Minimizes changes to existing file access patterns.

### 🏥 **Q65 — PHI Detection in Medical Documents**

**Amazon Textract**

    💡 Extracts text and structured data from PDF or image files.

    ➡️ Automates text extraction from scanned or uploaded reports.

**Amazon Comprehend Medical**

    💡 NLP service to detect and classify medical entities and PHI.

    ➡️ Identifies sensitive data automatically with minimal coding.

**PHI Detection** = **Protected Health Information Detection**


PHI Detection is the process of identifying **sensitive medical data** — such as patient names, addresses, medical record numbers, or diagnoses — inside documents, images, or text.

---

### ➡️ **Use case**

In AWS, PHI detection is often done using:

* **Amazon Textract** → Extracts text from PDFs or images.
* **Amazon Comprehend Medical** → Scans the extracted text to **detect and classify PHI** automatically (e.g., “John Doe”, “Diabetes”, “123-45-6789”).

Used in healthcare applications to stay **HIPAA-compliant** and **protect patient privacy** when processing medical documents or reports.

### 🧊 **Q66 — S3 Cost Optimization (Lifecycle)**

**S3 Lifecycle Policy**

    💡 Automates transition between storage classes over time.

    ➡️ Reduces cost while maintaining required retention period.

**S3 Standard-IA / Glacier**

    💡 Infrequent access and archival storage tiers.

    ➡️ Ideal for rarely accessed but long-retained data.

---

### 📬 **Q67 — SQS Message Duplication Prevention**

**Visibility Timeout**

    💡 Hides a message during processing to prevent reprocessing.

    ➡️ Extend timeout to ensure each message is handled once.

**Idempotent Processing**

    💡 Design applications to safely handle duplicate deliveries.

    ➡️ Ensures data consistency even if messages are retried.

---

### 🔗 **Q68 — Hybrid Connectivity with Redundancy**

**AWS Direct Connect (DX)**

    💡 Dedicated high-bandwidth, low-latency private connection to AWS.

    ➡️ Ideal for hybrid architectures requiring stable performance.

**VPN Backup for DX**

    💡 Site-to-Site VPN as failover for Direct Connect.

    ➡️ Provides cost-effective redundancy when primary link fails.

---

### 🏗️ **Q69 — Multi-AZ High Availability Setup**

**Auto Scaling Group (Multi-AZ)**

    💡 Distributes EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.

    ➡️ Improves fault tolerance for web tiers.

**Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ**

    💡 Provides synchronous replication for high availability.

    ➡️ Minimizes downtime and data loss with managed failover.
